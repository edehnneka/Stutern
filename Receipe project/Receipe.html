   <h1>Oha(Ora) Soup</h1>
   <div>
   <p>
    Oha soup is a Nigerian delicacy from the Eastern region, it is commonly prepared by the Igbo peopple from an evergreen tree whose botanical name is Pterocarpus mildraedii.
    The main ingredient for the soup is the oha leaf, others include uziza,achi (soup thickener), meat, crayfish ,palm oil and salt.
    It is a very traditional soup similar to the bitterleaf soup but cooked with Ora leaves. 
    Oha Soup is special because the tender ora leaves used in preparing this soup recipe are seasonal unlike their bitterleaf counterpart which can be found all year round.
