        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: green">
        Technology stimulates my imagination. Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. 
        Computers are increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. 
        With all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun.
        Technology helps me organize my life and work better, allows me to access information the moment I need it.
        The idea that something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my love and passion for Technology.
        I love technology because its about people and building better tools for them. Tools by definition help you do work. And the work that we’re doing is ultimately about people.

            <b>What I have learned so far and how CSS is important</b>
            </p>
    
            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: red">
                So far, I have learnt about HTML and currently learning CSS because to understand the basics of how CSS works, one must first understand a little about modern HTML. 
                CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. 
                Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.
                CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.
                Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
                Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. 
                HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language. Think “look and feel” when you think CSS.
                
                <p style="font-size: 14px; color: red">
                CSS allowed several innovations to webpage layout, such as the ability to:
                <ul style="font-size: 14px; color: red">
                    <li>Specify fonts other than the default for the browser</li>
                    <li>Specify color and size of text and links</li>
                    <li>Apply colors to backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Contain webpage elements in boxes and float those boxes to specific positions on the page</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
        </p>
        </div>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                <b>Difference between paddings, margins, and borders</b>
                </p>

                
                <p style="font-size: 14px; color: blue">
                    In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. It is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
                    In CSS Box Model, every html element is considered as a rectangular box. That box can have content(width & height), padding, margin, and border.

                    <ul style="font-size: 14px; color: blue">
                        <li><b>Padding</b> - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.
                            The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined margins and/or borders. 
                            Padding values are set using lengths or percentages, and cannot accept negative values. The initial, or default, value for all padding properties is 0.
                        </li>

                        &nbsp;

                        <li><b>Margin</b> - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
                            A margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. 
                            Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
                        </li>

                        &nbsp;

                        <li><b>Border</b> - The perimeter of the box.
                            The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to.
                            The border property defines the width, line style, and color of the border of a box. 
                            It is a shorthand property for setting the border-width, border-style, and border-color CSS properties.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
